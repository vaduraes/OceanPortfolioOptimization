A temporary adjustment was made to the original costs estimated by Mary.


Consider Kite Mass not changing significantly at: 88644Kg
Consider PTO Mass as 66028Kg/200KW
Consider Price of steel at 2$/kg (Original Sharks)
Consider OPEX at 293.673$/KW-yr (Original Sharks)
Consider FCR=0.082 (Original Sharks)

Name RP: Device Rated Power in KW

Device Mass (DM)= 66028/200*RP+88644
OPEX            = 293.673*RP

Annualized Cost = DM*2*FCR + OPEX
